## Why md-bider Wins Attention

- **Instant writing flow**: Launch directly into `IR` mode and start typing immediately.
- **Desktop-grade tabs**: Chrome-like tab behavior for true multi-file local editing.
- **CJK-safe file handling**: `UTF-8` + `UTF-16 BOM` + detector + `GBK` fallback.
- **Rust-powered runtime**: Compiled native core for stable, predictable desktop behavior.
- **Truly offline**: Core editor assets are embedded and ready without network access.

## md-bider vs Typical Markdown Editors

| Dimension | Typical Experience | md-bider |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time-to-first-word | Setup first, writing later | Open and write instantly |
| Local multi-file work | Single-document oriented | Native tabbed workflow |
| CJK/legacy encoding | UTF-8 only in many cases | UTF-16 BOM + detect + GBK fallback |
| Offline confidence | Plugin/network dependency risk | Embedded assets, offline-ready |
| Desktop architecture | Browser-shell-first pattern | Rust-native shell + local-first IO |

## Why Rust Is a Real Product Advantage

md-bider is not "web app in disguise." It uses a Rust desktop shell (`tao + wry`) with local file IO and deterministic command/event boundaries. The practical result is lower runtime friction, cleaner packaging, and dependable behavior on real desktop workflows.

## Feature Set

| Capability | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Editing modes | `IR`, `SV`, `WYSIWYG` |
| Tabbed workflow | Create, switch, and close multiple local markdown files |
| File operations | New, open, save, save as |
| Keyboard shortcuts | `Ctrl+N / Ctrl+O / Ctrl+S / Ctrl+Shift+S / Ctrl+W` |
| CLI opening | `md-bider.exe <file.md>` |
| Offline runtime | JS/CSS/i18n assets embedded in binary |
