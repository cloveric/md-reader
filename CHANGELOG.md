# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Keep the preview sidebar hidden in `IR` and `WYSIWYG` modes so split layout only appears in `SV`.

### Added

- New file workflow: toolbar `新建` button and `Ctrl + N` shortcut.
- Full offline embedded assets for editor runtime (JS/CSS/icon/i18n).
- Startup file argument support: open a markdown file directly from CLI.

### Changed

- Default editor mode switched to `IR` (所见即所得).
- Toolbar action set restored and hardened for daily authoring.
- Chinese-first typography and display stability improvements.

### Fixed

- Resource bootstrap failures caused by missing injected payloads.
